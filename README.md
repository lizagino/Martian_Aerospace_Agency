KaseiCoin - Martian Cryptocurrency
Welcome to the KaseiCoin project, the future cryptocurrency of the first human colony on Mars. This README provides a simplified overview of the project and its objectives.

Background
You have been selected by the Martian Aerospace Agency to lead the development of a monetary system for the upcoming Mars colony. Leveraging your expertise as a fintech professional, you've chosen to implement a blockchain-based monetary system and introduce a new cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin (KAI), where "Kasei" means "Mars" in Japanese.

KaseiCoin will be an ERC-20 compliant fungible token, and you will launch a crowdsale to allow future Martian colonists to exchange their Earth currency for KaseiCoin.

What You're Creating
In this project, you will:

Create an ERC-20 compliant KaseiCoin token contract.
Develop a KaseiCoin crowdsale contract using OpenZeppelin's Solidity library.
Set up a KaseiCoin deployer contract.
Conduct a real-world pre-production test of the crowdsale using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.
Optionally, enhance the crowdsale contract's functionality by adding time restrictions, refund capabilities, and a cap for token creation using OpenZeppelin.
Getting Started
To start working on this project:

Use the provided starter files with Solidity version 0.5.5.

Create the KaseiCoin token and crowdsale contracts.

Deploy the contracts on a local blockchain using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.

Optionally, extend the crowdsale contract's functionality with OpenZeppelin features.

Testing and Documentation
To ensure the successful deployment and operation of your KaseiCoin cryptocurrency, record a short video or take screenshots that demonstrate the deployed contract in action. This will serve as documentation for the project.

Contributing
While this project is primarily a solo endeavor, we welcome any contributions, suggestions, or improvements you may have in mind.
